| save | nothing | it was correct, as I knew |I knew this one was correct, but as I was unsure about one command, and checking another, I figured "might as well check them all"|
|open|nothing|once again correct| I was pretty sure, but not as sure, about this one. But, after double checking, I now know it's correct |
|exit|changed from F14 to F4|alt+f4 is exit, not alt+14|So, for some reason I thought it was alt+F14. But, I noticed my computer (and many others) only have F1 to F12. So, I realized I might be wrong, and double checked. Turned out it's alt+f4. In fact, it was this very observation which made me decide to check all the shortcut commands, even ones I knew for a fact!|

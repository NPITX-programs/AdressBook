instead of useing the generate list that was there. It was based on the total list length, but as the entire file was read first...
however, if I'm correct and this system only needs to run while it's loading a file, I can make a system similar to the old one, and with modifications fully integrate it into the reading of the file

	- for instance, the "next entry" might make sense to go elsewhere. If that is done, then we can go back to utilizing something similar to the old one.

for adding from the saved file, the idea is that the "add" function can be modified to output the whole thing/ be used to get all of the entrie.

that way, the order is:

1. open
2. read file
3. split CSV
4. create classes based on CSV
5. add that into the list
6. use this to add it to the contacts
7. done!
